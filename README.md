## Introduction

Understanding how models perform across different domains, variations and nuances is crucial for developing robust and generalizable algorithms. 
This code aims to provide standardized evaluation metrics to assess linguistic nuance, historical variation and specificity capability. 

## Repository Structure

- `corpus/`: Contains datasets used for the experiments.
- `src/`: Source code for preprocessing,synonyms generations, evaluations and utilities.
- `results/`: Directory to store results.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies required to run the code.

## Installation

To set up the environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vs1rr/domain_specificity_benchmark.git
   cd domain_specificity_benchmark
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install the required dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

To run the experiments, follow these steps:

1. **Create API keys** for GPT and Merriam-Webster Thesaurus.
2. **Pre-process the corpus** using the scripts in the `corpus_processing/` folder.
3. **Generate synonyms** using the code in the `syn_generation/` folder.
4. **Evaluate the results** by running the scripts in the `evaluation/` folder.

The benchmark implementation is available in:
```
src/evaluation/benchmark.py
```
